        <p class="subheader">
          This world is full of nonsense, bureaucracy, and people who don't eat
          enough bacon. Luckily, Ron Swanson is here to set you straight.

          Click a card to receive a hard-hitting dose of wisdom, hand-selected by
          Ron himself (or at least, an algorithm that respects his mustache).

        <p class="subheader">
          Whether it's advice on work, school or the only food groups that matter
          (meat and whiskey), prepare to become a better, stronger, more
          self-sufficient human.

          Go ahead. Click a card... or don't. I'm not your boss.
